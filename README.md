# Designed a Smart Parking Lot System

Objective: Design the low-level architecture for a backend system of a smart parking lot. This system should handle vehicle entry and exit management, parking space allocation, and fee calculation.


## Implementation

- Parking Spot Allocation: Automatically assign an available parking spot to a vehicle when it enters, based on the vehicleâ€™s size (e.g., motorcycle, car, bus).
  
- Check-In and Check-Out: Record the entry and exit times of vehicles.

- Parking Fee Calculation: Calculate fees based on the duration of stay and vehicle type.

- Real-Time Availability Update: Update the availability of parking spots in real-time as vehicles enter and leave.

- Data Model: Design a database schema to manage parking spots, vehicles, and parking transactions.

- Algorithm for Spot Allocation: Develop an algorithm to efficiently assign parking spots to incoming vehicles.

- Fee Calculation Logic: Implement logic to calculate fees based on parking duration and vehicle type.

- Concurrency Handling: Ensure the system can handle multiple vehicles entering or exiting simultaneously.
